# Frontend vs Backend — What Should I Pick?

❓ My Confusion:  
I didn’t know what suited me more — frontend felt visual, backend felt logical.  
I kept switching tutorials and didn’t make real progress.

🧠 What I Did:  
I tried both. Built one basic frontend UI → then added backend with Node.js.  
I realized I liked the visual + interactive part more.

✅ What I’d Recommend:  
Try both. Build a full-stack mini app (like notes app).  
See which part you enjoy more — UI or data/logic.

📌 TL;DR:  
You don’t need to pick on Day 1. Explore both → choose what excites you.
