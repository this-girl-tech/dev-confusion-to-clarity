# I Didn’t Know What to Build

❓ My Confusion:  
I had HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics. But no idea what project to make.  
I kept doing to-do apps, calculators. Then got bored.

🧠 What I Did:  
I started copying real websites I used — weather apps, blog pages, portfolio clones.  
Then I picked one pain point and tried solving it with a real app.

✅ What I’d Recommend:  
Stop Googling “10 project ideas.”  
Build things you *use* or see around you — even if they’re small.

📌 TL;DR:  
Start by cloning. Then slowly start solving. You’ll level up fast.
