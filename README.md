# 🧭 Dev Path Confusion

> A personal repo sharing all the confusion I faced as a self-taught developer — and what I’d do differently now.

This is not a tutorial repo.

This is about the real questions I had in my mind when I was trying to learn to code:  
what to build, what to learn next, and what everyone else already seems to know.

I've written each answer short and real — based on my experience.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

There are 1000s of tutorials out there.  
But no one talks about the *confusion*.

This is the repo I wish existed when I started.
