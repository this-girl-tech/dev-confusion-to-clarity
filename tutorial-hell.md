# I’m Stuck in Tutorial Hell

❓ My Confusion:  
I kept finishing tutorials but couldn’t build anything alone.  
I thought I didn’t know “enough” yet. So I kept watching more.

🧠 What I Did:  
I forced myself to build a small project *without* looking at videos.  
Even though it took time, it clicked in my brain.

✅ What I’d Recommend:  
Finish 1–2 tutorials → then stop.  
Start building *without guidance*. Google when you’re stuck.  
Struggling = real learning.

📌 TL;DR:  
Tutorials don’t teach thinking. Projects do.  
Build ugly → then improve.
