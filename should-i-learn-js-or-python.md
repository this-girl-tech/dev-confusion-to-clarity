# JavaScript vs Python — Which to Learn First?

❓ My Confusion:  
Should I learn JavaScript or Python first?  
People said Python is beginner-friendly. But JavaScript is used in frontend. I didn’t want to pick the wrong one.

🧠 What I Did:  
I started with Python. Built a few scripts, understood basic logic.  
Then I jumped to JavaScript to learn frontend.

✅ What I’d Recommend:  
If you want to build websites → start with JavaScript.  
If you want to go into data or automation → Python is a great start.  
But both teach logic — don’t overthink.

📌 TL;DR:  
Pick the one that excites you more. You can always switch after basics.
