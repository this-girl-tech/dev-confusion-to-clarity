# When Should I Learn TypeScript?

❓ My Confusion:  
Everyone was talking about TypeScript. But I didn’t even know React yet.  
Should I wait? Or start early?

🧠 What I Did:  
I ignored it. Built 3–4 React projects with JS.  
Then converted one project to TypeScript after watching 1 crash course.

✅ What I’d Recommend:  
Learn JavaScript first → then React → then TypeScript.  
TS makes more sense once you already understand JS patterns.

📌 TL;DR:  
TypeScript is amazing — but only *after* JS + React basics.
