# Do I Need to Learn DSA to Get a Job?

❓ My Confusion:  
Everyone on YouTube said: "DSA is must."  
But I just wanted to build stuff. I didn’t know if skipping DSA was wrong.

🧠 What I Did:  
I learned a few basic patterns: arrays, maps, recursion.  
But I didn’t go deep before building projects.

✅ What I’d Recommend:  
If your goal is a product/dev job → start with projects.  
If you want FAANG or CP → yes, do DSA seriously.  
But don’t let DSA stop you from learning to code.

📌 TL;DR:  
Learn enough DSA to survive. But build things — that’s where you learn fastest.
