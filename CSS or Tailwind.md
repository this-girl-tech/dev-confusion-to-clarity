CSS or Tailwind — Which One Should I Learn?

❓ My Confusion:
I saw everyone using Tailwind. I felt behind because I didn’t even understand flexbox yet.

🧠 What I Did:
First learned basic CSS → positioning, flexbox, grid.
Then switched to Tailwind — and it felt 100x easier because I actually understood what the classes did.

✅ What I’d Recommend:
Don’t skip CSS fundamentals.
Tailwind becomes powerful only when you understand how CSS works underneath.

📌 TL;DR:
CSS = foundation.
Tailwind = shortcut.
Learn both, in that order.
