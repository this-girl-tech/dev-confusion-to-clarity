❓ My Confusion:
Some tutorials used MongoDB, others used MySQL. I had no idea what was right for a beginner.
NoSQL? Relational? Indexes? It felt overwhelming.

🧠 What I Did:
I followed the tutorial blindly and used MongoDB. Only later I realized I didn’t understand how databases actually work.

✅ What I’d Recommend:
If you’re building beginner projects → use MongoDB (easier setup, flexible).
If you want to get serious about DBs and interviews → learn MySQL and relational DBs first.

📌 TL;DR:
MongoDB is great for fast prototyping.
MySQL helps you understand the core DB concepts.
Learn one well → the second becomes 10x easier.
